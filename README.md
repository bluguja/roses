# ROSE APP
Welcome to the roses app. This app was created so as the use can interact seamlessly with the app.The app is supposes to be updated with types of roses
that the user has in mind. The method to do that is shown in the 'Usage' section of this README


## Restful Routes and CRUD Actions

REST => Representation State Transfer => set of conventions for structuring our ROUTES and mapping them to CRUD actions (Create, Read, Update, Delete).

  | HTTP VERB | ROUTE | ACTION   | CRUD Function |
| ------------- |-------------| ----------- | ------------------- |
| GET |  /roses  | index | Read |
| GET | /roses/:id | show | Read |
| GET | /roses/new | new | Create |
| POST | /roses | create | Create |
| GET | /roses/:id/edit | edit | Update |
| PATCH (PUT)* | /roses/:id | update | Update |
| DELETE | /roses/:id | delete | Delete |

*(patch modifies, put replaces)
